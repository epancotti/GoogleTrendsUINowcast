# State Policy Actions

In recent weeks, Governors across the US have issued executive orders requiring that businesses change or limit their in-person operations. In most states, restaurants are only permitted to operate take-out and/or delivery services. While some restaurants have opted to stay open and attempt to weather the storm with reduced operations, others have shut down entirely. This has resulted in mass layoffs in the food service industry across the country, contributing to the skyrocketing UI claims numbers. 

Further, in some states, Governors have called for all non-essential businesses to close. Many shops and malls, theaters and museums, gyms and yoga studios, and concert halls and clubs have been ordered to cease operations. While some businesses can scale up their e-commerce operations or survive on take-out orders alone, many are forced to lay off their workers. 

The timing of states' closure orders have varied, so we've put together some maps to show the timing.

#Set up data

We define partial closures as orders that prohibited restaurants from having patrons dine in. In many states, other provisions were included in these orders (e.g., limits on gathering sizes, requirements for bars/clubs to close). We use the switch to take-out only for consistency. 

We define complete closures as orders for non-essential businesses to close. States vary in their definitions of essential businesses, and some states also put stay at home or shelter in place orders. For consistency, we hone in specifically on the non-essential business closures. 

Both of these definitions are consistent with analyzing policy effects on UI claims and search activity -- as businesses close, layoffs increase.
